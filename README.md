**Overview**

This repository serves as a portfolio of Java-based projects focused on implementing and manipulating various data structures. Each project within contains distinct programs ranging from environmental simulations to interactive music libraries and resource management in a restaurant setting. These assignments are designed to reflect real-world applications and showcase the depth of understanding in Java data structures.

**Projects**

The series of assignments contained progresses through the application of different data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tablesâ€”each chosen for their suitability in addressing the specific requirements of the problem domain. Below is a brief overview of the projects, along with the key concepts they illustrate:

1. **Rising Tides Simulation** - Utilizes two-dimensional arrays and union-find structures to model flooding scenarios, providing dynamic visualization of environmental impacts using graph traversal methods such as breadth-first search.

2. **Music Streaming Service Library** - Demonstrates the use of circular linked lists and ArrayLists to create and manage user playlists that simulate the data structure of a music streaming service's vast library, enhancing understanding of how modern streaming platforms efficiently handle large sets of data.

3. **Hunger Games Simulation** - Employs binary search trees to represent a dystopian world's district structure, capturing the complexity of population management while highlighting BST operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

4. **RUHungry Restaurant Management** - Showcases a multi-faceted approach by integrating 2D arrays, 1D arrays, linked lists, and hash tables to run a simulated restaurant. It covers aspects like seating arrangements, stockroom management, and transaction recording, emphasizing search and hashing algorithms' significance in inventory and order processing systems.

Each project is unique in its approach and provides clear evidence of the ability to tackle intricate problems using data structures. Through these assignments, I've demonstrated my understanding of the Java programming language and its capabilities in organizing, storing, and manipulating data efficiently.

**Skills and Concepts**

The following fundamental skills and concepts are covered across the projects:

- Array manipulation and interaction between 1D and 2D arrays
- Linked list operations, including circular linked list implementation
- Tree structures like binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient data sorting and retrieval
- Hash table utilization for quick access and manipulation, including custom hash functions and collision resolution strategies
- Recursive and iterative algorithms for traversal and search operations
